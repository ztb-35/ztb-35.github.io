<!-- The advent of ubiquitous computing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an explosion of data. Traditional centralized machine learning models face challenges, including limited bandwidth in wireless environments and privacy concerns due to their data aggregation approach. Federated learning addresses these challenges via decentralizing model training across numerous devices, leveraging model updates to enhance privacy and reduce communication overhead. To improve its cost efficiency, current research focuses on minimizing either time or energy costs but rarely both, and does not jointly optimize the parameters of device and training scheduling in the presence of system and data heterogeneity inherent in IoT networks. In our article, we first introduce a multigroup transmission scheme and propose a comprehensive device scheduling framework, group scheduling on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (GS-OFDMA), to address time bottlenecks. Then we formulate a joint optimization problem for device and training scheduling that minimizes the total cost of training while ensuring model convergence. To tackle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an iterative algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the total cost by at least 35% across various real-world datasets and data distributions in comparison with random participant selection. The proposed GS-OFDMA protocol also exhibits higher time efficiency over other device scheduling schemes. -->
