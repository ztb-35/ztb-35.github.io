I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Louisiana State University, advised by Prof. Mingxuan Sun. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning systems, trustworthy AI, and applied AI for time-series and cyber-physical systems.

My primary research focuses on LLM-enabled multimodal time-series forecasting, backdoor attacks on transformer models, and AI-driven risk analysis in real-world domains such as autonomous driving. I am particularly interested in designing practical, data-efficient, and reliable learning systems that bridge foundation models with domain-specific constraints.

I am currently seeking Research Scientist, Applied Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineer positions starting in 2026.
