As a experience Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Louisiana State University, 
I supported undergraduate instruction across core systems, programming, and machine learning courses. 
My responsibilities included grading programming assignments and exams, leading lab sessions, 
assisting students with hands-on coding projects, and providing technical guidance during office hours. 
I worked closely with course instructors to reinforce conceptual understanding and practical problem-solving skills.
