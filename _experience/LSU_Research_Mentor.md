I have served as a **Graduate Assistant and Research Mentor** at Louisiana State University, supporting undergraduate, master’s, and Ph.D. students across core computer science courses and independent research projects. My responsibilities span instructional support, hands-on laboratory guidance, and one-on-one research mentoring, with a strong emphasis on programming, experimental methodology, and applied machine learning research.

I actively mentored students on **research projects and theses**, guiding them through problem formulation, literature review, experimental design, and technical writing.

I have mentored students at different academic levels, including:

- **Muhammad Tahir Khan** (Ph.D. student, LSU)  
  *Thesis mentoring on time series forecasting and machine learning models.*

- **Roohana Karim** (Master’s student, LSU)  
  *Project mentoring on large language model (LLM) prompting strategies and experimental methodology.*

- **Havan Pleasant** (Undergraduate student, LSU)  
  *Mentor for a summer research project under the SMART REU program.*
