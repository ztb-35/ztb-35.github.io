I have served as a **Research Assistant and Research Mentor** at Northeastern University, supporting undergraduate students independent research projects. My responsibilities span instructional support, hands-on laboratory guidance, and one-on-one research mentoring, with a strong emphasis on programming, experimental methodology, and applied machine learning research.

I actively mentored students on **research projects and theses**, guiding them through problem formulation, literature review, experimental design, and technical writing.
